1. **Local Database**. All password stored as a hash, the main advantage of this type is a user can change his/her password via gui or via device cli (not all devices supported).
2. **LDAP Server**. Based on [Adldap2](https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2). Work with Windows AD and OpenLDAP.
3. **One-Time Password** (OTP). Based on [Spomky-Labs/otphp](https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/otphp). Authentication with OTP by using Google Authenticator, for example.

- **High Availability** based on MySQL Replication. All changes on Master will be available on Slave. In that case Slave also can be as a working auth-server, all full log will be stored on Master.
- **Configuration Manager** alpha version, but it is already have many advantages. It is works under Python and main library here's pexpect. All configuration files stored in git repository on server, it means that you won't have many files with different version you will have only one file with story of changes.

Hope you will enjoy it!
